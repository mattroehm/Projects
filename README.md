This project is a web-based Silent Auction Management System developed as part of the CIS 3870 Web Development course at Appalachian State University. The application was designed to support W.H. Taylor Elementary School’s PTA by streamlining the process of collecting, recording, and managing silent auction donations. The system focuses on Part 1 of the overall project, which covers soliciting and gathering donations, including donor registration, auction item entry, and the ability to retrieve and display stored information from a relational database.

The application was built using PHP for server-side logic and form handling, MySQL for relational database storage, and HTML/CSS for the frontend interface. Users can register donors, associate donated items with specific donors using foreign key relationships, and dynamically view stored data through PHP-driven pages. The database design emphasizes structured data storage and integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys.

This project was deployed using Azure App Service, with files transferred via FileZilla as part of the deployment workflow. While the application is functional and demonstrates core web development concepts such as database interaction, server-side scripting, and dynamic content generation, it was developed in an academic context and is not intended for production use. Future enhancements could include update and delete functionality, authentication and access control, improved user interface design, and additional security hardening.
